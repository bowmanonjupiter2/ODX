<p>PopupMenuBarItem widgets are the actual items in the menu, and like PopupMenuItem it displays a submenu or other widget below it. A PopupMenuBarItem always has two child nodes: a tag with the displayed label (usually in a SPAN tag), and a widget to be popped up, typically a dijit.Menu widget.</p>
<p>There’s also a dijit/MenuBarItem widget if you need an entry in your MenuBar that doesn’t have a drop down.</p>
