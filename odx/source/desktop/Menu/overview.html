<p>The Menu widget is used for context menus, otherwise known as a
	right-click or popup menus.</p>

<p>Previously Menu was also used for drop-down menus, but that
	functionality has been split off to the dijit/DropDownMenu widget.</p>

<p>Since Menu extends dijit/DropDownMenu, consult that page for
	general documentation about the children of Menu, etc.</p>
